If you like this theme checkout [One Dark Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=azemoh.theme-onedark).

## Is this original?
No, this theme is forked and improved from [one-monokai](https://github.com/azemoh/vscode-one-monokai).


### Why create this fork
I really like the color scheme of the original theme, but unfortunately the original theme has not been maintained for a long time, and I happen to have some other ideas.
