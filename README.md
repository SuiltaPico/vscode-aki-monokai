## Why create this fork
I really like the color scheme of the original theme, but unfortunately, the original theme is not friendly to other markup languages, and the maintainers have long ignored github issues. So I created this fork and generalized the markup language support. In the future, if necessary, I will continue to modify this theme and follow the original style.
